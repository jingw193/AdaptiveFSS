## 😮 Highlights
* This is the official code of Adaptive FSS, which has been accepted by AAAI 2024.
* It presents a novel FSS framework based on the adapter mechanism that can greatly improve the performance of the current FSS model by adapting it to novel classes.
* Tutorials for training and pre-training weight configuration are placed at [Tutorials](https://github.com/jingw193/AdaptiveFSS/blob/main/tutorial.md)
